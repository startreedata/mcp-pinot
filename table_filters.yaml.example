# Table filter configuration
# Specify which tables to include when listing tables from Pinot.
# Supports glob patterns like "prefix_*" or "exact_table_name"
# If no filter file is configured, all tables will be returned.
#
# Future enhancement: As this expands, we may want to namespace configurations
# by controller/context to handle multiple Pinot controllers with different table filters.

# included_tables:
#  - some_table
